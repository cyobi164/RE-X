            Re:X is an otakugei (cyrium dance) group consisting of 11 members. As for our activities, we post videos taken in Toyosu and other places on YouTube. <br>
            Otaku (Psyllium Dance) is a dance that involves holding a psyllium (a stick that lights up when broken).<br>
            They show off their skills along with the music. <br>
            For detailed explanations and techniques, it's easier to understand if you see them than by explaining them in text.<br>
            If you are interested, please search for ``RE:X Otaku'' on YouTube. <br>

        <h2>What is Re:X</h2>
        <p>
            RE:X is a fan performance group formed in 2020. We primarily post videos on YouTube
            for our activities. 
            <img src="rex image/002.jpg" class="right-image">
            The team comprises 11 members, centered around leader 'Weird Squid,' with an additional 3 support members. 
            RE:X mainly films in Tokyo, particularly in 
            Toyosu and Kinshicho. We upload videos once a month, featuring not only RE:X members 
            but also collaborations with external individuals or other teams. 
            We invite everyone to take a look at RE:X's videos!"

        <h3>What is OtaGeki</h3>
        <p>
            Otagei (ヲタ芸) refers to a dance style that emerged around 2009, 
            utilizing glow sticks called "cyalumes." It has gained popularity<br>
            overseas as 'Cyalume Dance.' Otagei involves using favorite songs
            or trending tracks, constructing 'moves' based on the <br> selected song's mood or imagery, 
            and dancing while coordinating the colors of the glow sticks.
            <br>

            <br>
            Additionally, enthusiasts can create their own moves, 
            upload them on platforms like Twitter, and other teams or individuals might use them. 
            Otagei isn't limited to Japan; it's an originating cultural dance form from Japan.<br>
            You can also create your own techniques and upload them to Twitter etc. 
            for other teams or individuals to use.
            Wotagei is not a culture limited to Japan. Otaku itself is a culture 
            that originated in Japan. <br>
            <br>
            <span class="gap-0"></span>
            It is now gaining recognition all over the world, including the United States, China, South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Singapore.
            It may seem difficult to start otaku, but on YouTube, various professional teams are showing off their moves.
            Things that explain things and how to connect techniques, etc.
            I am uploading videos for beginners. If you are interested, why not give it a try?
